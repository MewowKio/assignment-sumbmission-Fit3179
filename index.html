        <p class="description">
          In the modern world one of the crucial issues that we are facing is world hunger.
          Several factors are driving this issue more and more mainstream with the time passing by.
          the limitedness of the resourses available is one of the main reasons for world hunger.
          in this visualiziation we will go over the topics and factors that affects world hunger and identify
          the countries that are suffering from it and if there are any signs of development of this issue over time.

            <b>World Hunger Index</b><br>
            <br>
            We have gatherd data from 2005 to 2020 to see the trend of the world hunger index.
            with that we were able to identify many countries are suffering from world hunger mainly countries such as,
            <br>
            <br>
            - Somalia<br>
            - Chad<br>
            - Namibia<br>
            - Sudan<br>
            - Madagascar<br>
            <br>

            These countries have developed over the years but still not have found an solution for the world hunger that exists in their 
            own terretorries. compared to developed countries like the United states,United Kindom,Austrlia,Japan,Germany we can notice that 
            their prevalance has been on a steady level which is really low and also improving over time.
            <br>
            <br>
            We can conclude that their economies are far more developed and their infrastructure to develop these major issues gets far more attention
            reletively to other other countries.Their economical grows plays a key factor on these developments and one of those economical key factors 
            is the Gross Domestic Product which we will discuss in the next topic.

            <b>Gross Domestic Product</b><br>
            <br>
            Gross Domestic Product of a country is the mesure of value added to a country with their produced goods and services.GDP can be identified as the key factor
            to indicate the coutnries development.
            Developing countries tend to have a lower GDP than the Developed countries which pushes them more towards the issues like world hunger that affects their GDP negetively.
            in this vizualisaition we got 5 countries with the highest GDP and the GDP of the countries that have highest number of world hunger prevalnce. This comparision prevailed 
            the fact that the countries with high world hunger prevelance have a large gap between the GDP with the countries that have low prevelance. with that we can conclude that
            world hunger is affected by the econmical factors such as GDP.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Economic growth depends mostly on the government's decisions which in some countries power have been tragically abused where the citizens of the country have to pay the price
            of their bad decisions. In these cases the countries driven to the ground increaseing the powerty levels which furthur leads to the modern society to face the world hunger due to
            the abused power and the inability to develop the country bt their leaders. Special circumstances like this will require international parties to interfere and support those who suffering
            because of their policitcal leaders.
            <br>
            in order to move away from these isssues consistant growth of the economy would be benficital which we will discuss in the next topic. we can also identify which countries
            have been developing consitantly from the earliest as 2000.

            <b>Gross Domestic Product Growth</b><br>
            <br>
             in any circumstance consistancy is what plays a major role in development.Economical factors also follow the same principle where they develp consistantly to maintain 
             their infrastructures and their country developments.
            <br>
             this visualiziation clearly displays how consistnt growth plays a major role when it comes to econmical growth. Countries like United states, United Kindom, Germany,Japan
             have been through major ecomical situations but still prevailed to be on top of the majority of the countries due to their well planned and sustainable systems to carry out 
             their processes. India is included in this visualiziation as a mid level country that is developing and we can identify that the country is having consitant growth and 
             currently becoming a production hub to many goods and services provided all around the world.  <br> 
             <br>this will support the countries living standerd to develop when those industries
             will provide job opperunties for those who are in need. even this wont happen over night we are already seeing the current movements in the industires in india. with those developments 
             india still did not improve their world hunger prevelance but it actually increased over time and we will also discuss why that is happening.
             <br>
             <br>
             Even other coutries that attrract many tourists have been having high number of prevlance like Madagascar which leads to the qustion what do we need other than development of the economy
             to move away from the world hunger prevalnce.

            <b>Wasting In Relation To Malnutrition</b><br>
            <br>
            This topic has been discussed on several platforms but still failed to gain the neccasry attention that it requires. due to the modern day standerds that have been set
            to assure quality for consumer consumtion has been leading to heavy food waste. Because these standerds are applied in developed countries they usually dispose food at a rapid
            rate to keep up with those standerd. for an example in countries like Austrlia,America,England they are disposing fast foods daily at intervals even when the food is still considerd a good state
            for consumption.
            <br>
            <br>
             In this visualiziation we can identify that there is a reletionship between malnutrition and food waste. as the econmical factors still affect the prevalance of world hunger issues like This
             will have a long term effect where we will run in to reasourse shortages due to heavy waste of the available reasourses. when the qustion is arised industries mostly reply that they
             are producing to keep up with the demand of the population of the country which is an other aspect that affects the prevalance of world hunger which we will discuss in the next topic of this vizualisation.

            <b>Does Population Play A Role In World Hunger Prevelance?</b><br>
            <br>
            in the developing world an other aspect we are yet due to face is over population but in some countries they are already facing this issue. as the qustion that we are 
            tackling is to understand weather the popualtion plays a role in prevalnce of wolrd hunger. the answer for that is yes it does and it plays a major role explaining the situation
            faced in india even with economical growth theys still struggle to overcome the prevalnce of world hunger due to over populated areas and high poverty levels due to the density
            of those higly populated areas
            <br>
            <br>
             With all the topics we have disccussed we can come to an assumption that world hunger prevalnce cannot be stopped just by improving one aspect of the country where as it has to develop
             overall from all the aspects to move away from it. To support this cause we can assist international organisaitons like united nations with their projects that they are 
             carrying out to improve these conditons.Link for one of these projects have been attached below.We wont be able to control all the factors and support the cause but its always
             the best when you support the projects the way you are able to by being the change that you expect from the world.
